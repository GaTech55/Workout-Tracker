## Description

The purpose of this app is to allow a user to track their workouts. The workouts can be Cardio or Resistance and then the name, distance, weight, sets, reps and duration can be customized. Multiple exercises can be logged on a given day. The end goal for this app is to allow the user to reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
